Develop a simple text-based guessing game. 
The objective is to guess a number between 1 and 10.
The game will give feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.

Step 1: Choose a Game Type
We'll create a guessing game.

Step 2: Define the Game Rules and Logic
The computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 10.
The player has five attempts to guess the number.
After each guess, the game provides feedback:
If the guess is too high, it will say "Too high!"
If the guess is too low, it will say "Too low!"
If the guess is correct, it will say "Correct! You win!"
If the player doesn't guess the number within five attempts, they lose,
and the correct number is revealed.

Step 3: Test and Debug the Game for Correctness
To test and debug, we can run the code and simulate various scenarios:

1.Guess the correct number within five attempts.
2.Guess numbers that are too high and too low.
3.Exhaust all attempts without guessing the correct number.

This code includes error handling for non-integer inputs and ensures that the guessed number is within the valid range. 
This will make the game more robust and user-friendly.
